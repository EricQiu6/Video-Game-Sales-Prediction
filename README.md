# Video-Game-Sales-Prediction

This is a project I built to get myself familiarized with the machine learning/data science framework in python.

The program works with dataset from Kaggle (link in the introduction of the notebook) that contains video games
with their sales as well as other features like review scores, review counts, rating, developer, etc.

At the end the program successful achieved an accuracy of around 81%, a nice score for a first attempt.
